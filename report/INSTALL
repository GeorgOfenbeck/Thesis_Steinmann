Development Environment Setup
-----------------------------

To get all required latex packages, do
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-recommended

The report can be entirely developed from within eclipse. To do so, install texclipse. 
Update site:
http://texlipse.sourceforge.net/

To draw the UML diagrams, Umlet is used. There is an eclipse plugin and a standalone application, 
both located in the root folder. Copy

com.umlet.plugin_11.3.0.jar

to your eclipse plugin directory.

Extract 

umlet_11_3.zip

to your home folder. The makefile of the report uses the standalone application to render
the diagrams.
